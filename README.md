The file "TimeSeriesDDPM.ipynb" is a jupyter-notebook file containing the code to train and sample time series data. The UNet architecture is a rehased variant of a code for generating images(like MNIST, CIFAR, etc.) via a diffusion process. The input data has to be generated seperately and the correct filename needs to be mentioned in the code. The tensor shape of the time series need to be (number of time-series, 1, sequence length of each time series).
